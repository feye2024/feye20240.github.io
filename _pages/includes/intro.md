I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Industrial and Systems Engineering and has obtained a M.Sc. in Statistics at Rutgers-New Brunswick <img src='./images/rutgers.png' style='width: 2em;'>. 

My research aims to advance the integration of physics, statistics, and modern AI/ML by constructing physics-guided data science models for improved renewable energy forecasting and operation.
